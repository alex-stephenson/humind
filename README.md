`humind` provides functions to compose usual humanitarian composite
indicators related to IMPACT Multi-Sector Needs Assessments (MSNAs).
Such as:

- Food security indicators (rCSI, LCSI, HHS, FCS).
- Washington Group Short Set of questions (WG-SS).
- JMP ladders.
- Specific indicators related to the MSNI framework.

The package follows the ‘Step - Composition’ approach of IMPACT R
framework.

## Installation

You can install the latest stable version of `humind` from GitHub:

``` r
#loading the package, check install step above before if not installed!  
library(humind)

# Example usage (replace with the actual function name based on the desired output, check R directory for each function name)
dummy_data <- data.frame(
  dummy_variableA = c(1, 2, 3),
  dummy_variableB = c(2, 3, 1),
  dummy_variableC = c(0, 1, 2)
)

result <- dummy_function(dummy_data)
print(result)
```
